IP-Give, a simple yet useful tool.

To start the tool, download "IP-Give.bat" and open it.
IP-Give has three features so far, one to display the user's public, and private IP address, and one to generate a random IP address, ping it to see if it is up, checks if it is reachable, and saves it to a file. The last one is to get the IP address of any domain (that is up of course).

It is optional to save the IP addresses to a file, but, if you want to, you can chose between six different file formats: 
1. Text (.txt)
2. Comma-Separated Values (.csv)
3. Tab-Separated Values (.tsv)
4. Log File (.log)
5. Markdown (.md)
6. JSON (.json)
