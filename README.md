IP-Give, a simple yet useful tool.

To start the tool, download "IP-Give.bat" and open it.
IP-Give generates a random IP address, and checks if it is up.
It is optional to log the IP addresses to a file, but, if you want to, you can chose between six different file formats: 
1. Text (.txt)
2. Comma-Separated Values (.csv)
3. Tab-Separated Values (.tsv)
4. Log File (.log)
5. Markdown (.md)
6. JSON (.json)
